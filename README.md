The contact-saving app leverages Firebase as the backend for data storage and management.Firebase's real-time database provides seamless synchronization of contact data,
enabling users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with ease. The app architecture follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, ensuring a
clean separation of concerns.
Key Features and Technical Details:
Firebase Storage Integration: Firebase acts as the core storage solution, where all contact data, including names, phone numbers, and images, are stored. The real-time database offers low-latency data syncing, which is crucial for providing a responsive user experience.

CRUD Operations: The app allows users to add new contacts, update existing entries, and delete unwanted contacts. These operations are handled through Firebase's real-time database APIs, ensuring that data changes are instantly reflected across all devices.

Picasso Image Library: For handling contact images, the app integrates the Picasso library, which efficiently loads and caches images. This library simplifies the process of downloading and displaying images from Firebase storage, optimizing memory usage and improving overall performance.

RecyclerView for Displaying Contacts: The app's main screen features a RecyclerView, which dynamically loads and displays all stored contacts. RecyclerView is chosen for its efficient handling of large datasets, providing smooth scrolling and a flexible layout manager. This setup ensures that the app remains performant even when dealing with extensive contact lists.

Data Binding and LiveData: For a more responsive UI, the app may incorporate data binding and LiveData to observe changes in the Firebase database, ensuring that any updates to contact information are automatically reflected in the UI without requiring manual refreshes.
